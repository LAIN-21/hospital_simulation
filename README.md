# Hospital Simulation

This repo creates a hospital simulation using the following scheme:

Times are made to vary from the mean values using an exponential distribution in order to make a realisitc simulation. 

The script repeats the experiment 100 times and stores the averages in a csv file (attached). The averages include every queue, every waiting time, as well as the total time for both systems. Interesting to note how the queue times relating to the receptionist are specially large, this is due to the high demand of work and only having one receptionist.

Finally, it also prints the average of all columns to the console.
